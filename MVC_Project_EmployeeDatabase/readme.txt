MVC Project Employee Database is a sample project designed to use MVC and Entity framework.

I used C# and HTML to program this Asp project.

This program pulls employee information from a database. 

First, go to SetupDatabase.
Next, Web.config to view server connection information.
Then create MVC project like normal.
